# Battleship
Created a battleship game using pygame, along with 3 different solvers for the game

The First Solver Randomly picks values on the board until it completes it 

the Second Solver utilized the Pytorhc library by implemeting reinforcment Machine Learning. not optimized and did not see good results

The third makes heavy use of the numpy library and picks squares solely based on mathematics. It plays perfectly and will beat any competitor over the long run
