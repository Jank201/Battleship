# Battleship
Created a battleship game using pygame, along with 3 different solvers for the game

The First Solver, (RandomGuesser), Randomly picks values on the board until it completes it 

the Second Solver, (MLAgent), utilized the Pytorch library by implemeting reinforcment Machine Learning. not optimized and did not see good results

The third,(MathSolver), makes heavy use of the numpy library and picks squares solely based on mathematics using Vectors. It plays perfectly and will beat any competitor over the long run.

Next Steps
- Add Support For variable ship sizes and ship numbers
- Create Website that lets players play Against the Algos
- Upgrade ML Algo
- Take in Player Data (where they place their ships) to increase effectiveness of the ML Algo
- Become the Best Battleship player in the world
